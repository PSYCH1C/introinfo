##Promoting STEM with Youth for Community Innovation and Change
"Today's children are tomorrow's future."  That is what we are constantly told, and more and more we are seeing how young adults are taking it upon themselves to change the world.  As STEM fields are stressed more and more in certain public school systems, we want to bring together the love for science with the ability to make change.  An innovator is often identified as someone who can view an old problem through a new lens and thus drive new and alternative solutions.  We want to help deliver the tools and resources to young adults so that they can ask old and new questions, track down answers, and share their knowledge with the world.

##Goal
To help young adults evaluate the world critically and quanititatively.

##Methodology
###Outreach and Partnership
This project is starting in the Central Maryland area.  Public school systems in this area are already encouraging students to acquire STEM skills in mathematics, the sciences, computer programming, and more.  We want to partner with these educational programs to provide additional resources and outlets for student education and innovation.  
###Mentorship
This project is initiated by professionals and volunteers from leading technology firms in the area.  These experts have their own mentors, and can in turn mentor students.  What questions are waiting to be answered?  How have they been approached before?  Where is the data?  Where are the experts?  Why is my code broken?!  We want to help young adults learn from those who have come before them, while still respecting their own ability to rethink problems and contribute.
###Collaboration
Though this program is created with young adults and high school students in mind, all are welcome.  The key part of this initiative is the sharing aspect.  We want contributors to share their questions, problems, and findings, so that they can find others who are interested in helping and inspire future learners and researches.  Collaboration can happen between students and mentors.  The beauty is that the questions we aim to answer are asked by young and old alike.
###Education
All project members are encouraged to regularly contribute helpful links, articles, data sources, and educational materials.  Additionally, we hope to have occasional in person sessions in which students can collaborate, ask questions, or perhaps learn about a specific topic or technical challenge.
##How to Get Involved
